# A05: Student advisor

Using the [Drools rules engine](/notes/drools.html), write rules for a
student advisor expert system. A student advisor would guide students
on class selection based on their major (and corresponding major
requirements), the classes they have already taken and their grade,
and their interests. For this assignment, we'll restrict our focus to
CSCI majors, and we'll ignore non-major classes and general education
requirements.

## Knowledge base

### Facts

Recall that in Drools, "types" are effectively Java classes. However,
unless you need to implement additional functionality, you do not need
to write the class yourself; Drools will generate it to match the type
specification.

- `Student` type: name
- `Course` type: course name, course number, unit count; note, prerequisites can be complex so they're better represented as rules
- `Semester` type: semester name, year
- `CourseAttempt` type: student attempted a course in a particular semester and earned a particular grade
- `Preference` type: some student has some preference, e.g., preference for security or AI or networks

### Rules

- course prerequisites; these can be complex, e.g., prereqs for CSCI 211: "CSCI 141 and either MATH 141Q or MATH 130 or MATH 125Q"
- major requirements; include minimum GPA requirements

Refer to the [Stetson Catalog](http://catalog.stetson.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/computer-science/computer-science-bs/) for the requirements for a CSCI degree. You'll need to include some math courses as well as CSCI/CINF courses in order to represent the various prereqs and major requirements.

### Goals

- Which classes should I take next?
- Which classes do I still need?
- What are my options to satisfy some requirement, e.g., elective major courses?

## Deliverables

You will only submit the "drl" Drools rules file.
