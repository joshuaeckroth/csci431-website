# A05: Predicting student performance

Using [this dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance), build a decision tree with scikit-learn that predicts student performance in a math course. Instead of using the dataset's G1,G2,G3 columns, create a new "Pass" column defined as Pass=1 whenever (G1+G2+G3)>=35, 0 otherwise.

## Deliverables

Produce a single PDF (using Jupyter most likely) that includes the following:

- Code for all steps.
- A tree diagram, produced by graphviz.
- An explanation/interpretation of the tree diagram.
- 5-fold cross-validation accuracy score for various max-tree-depths.
- An example of using the best-scoring tree to predict a new row of data not included in the dataset (make up a row of data).

## Grading rubric

- 5 pts: All deliverables present.
- 4 pts: All deliverables present except the search for the best tree across several max-tree-depths.
- 3 pts: Only the code and tree diagram are present.
- 2 pts: Inappropriate dataset cleaning and processing, but decision tree code is correct.
- 0-1 pts: Inappropriate dataset cleaning and processing and incorrect decision tree code.
