# A08: Identifying Birds

Using [this dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html), build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that identifies a photograph of a bird as belonging to one of 200 species. (I have not completed the code myself, but I expect about 11% accuracy, based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02269.pdf)). The data is already on delenn: `/bigdata/data/birds-200-caltech-ucsd-2011/`. Use the photos, not the human-labeled attributes!

## Deliverables

Your Python code (single file).

## Grading rubric

- 5 pts: All deliverables present.
- 4 pts: All deliverables present except desired accuracy was not achieved (but it's close).
- 3 pts: All deliverables present except very poor accuracy (but valid CNN design).
- 2 pts: Inappropriate dataset processing, but most code is correct.
- 0-1 pts: Inappropriate dataset processing and most code is incorrect.
