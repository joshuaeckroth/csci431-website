# A08: Extra credit: Manatee Shmanatee

You may choose to complete this assignment for extra credit. If you get a good grade on this assignment, it will replace the grade for your lowest assignment (e.g., one you didn't turn in).

## Task

1. Find 50 "absent" and 10 "present" files from `/bigdata/data/manatees/splits` and place them in `/bigdata/data/manatees/present` and `/bigdata/data/manatees/absent` on delenn. Nathan Wolek's notes in the `_notes` folder will help find the times when manatees are present. I can see who created which files based on the file username (seen with `ls -l`); make sure you find present/absent files that no one else has already found. Copy equal splits of your files into the `train/` and `test/` folders also. Make sure you keep channels together (don't put ch6.split123 in test and ch5.split123 in train). Consider also using [Sonic Visualiser](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) on the MIXPRE files in the folders named after dates.
2. Build a convolutional neural net with binary outputs to predict present/absent. Include an appropriate evaluation on the test data. Try to get the highest possible accuracy.

Your submission will be graded on completeness and insight, i.e., finding a good model.
