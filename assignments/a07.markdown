# A07: Automated jury

This assignment helps you practice with abductive reasoning. Your task is to create an automated jury, i.e., a system that determines if a defendant is guilty or not by examing the evidence. We will use my [Paragon](/notes/paragon.html) system to encode the evidence and perform the reasoning.

Details forthcoming.
