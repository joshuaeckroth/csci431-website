# A11: Cats vs Dogs [Extra credit]

This extra credit assignment helps you practice using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library for deep learning. Your task is to build a convolutional neural net for separating pictures of cats from dogs, using images from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).

Because we have little time for this assignment, your task will be relatively easy. You are asked only to try some variations of example Keras code shown in class to produce, if possible, a better classifier.

This assignment is extra credit. Your score on this assignment will replace your lowest assignment score, assuming your score on this assignment is higher.
