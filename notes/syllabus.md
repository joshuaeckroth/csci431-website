# Syllabus

CSCI 431 - 01, Fall 2017 --- Artificial Intelligence

MWF 3:30-4:20p Eliz 210; pre-reqs: CSCI 221

This course covers a wide array of topics related to contemporary artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques and tools. Our focus will be on practical techniques that can be immediately applied outside of the classroom. By the end of the course, you should be able to apply an appropriate AI technique in a novel situation.

## About me

- Joshua Eckroth, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, [jeckroth@stetson.edu](mailto:jeckroth@stetson.edu), [homepage](http://www2.stetson.edu/~jeckroth/)

- Eliz Hall 214, 386-740-2519

- Office hours: Mon 1-3, Tue 5:30-6, Wed 2-3, Thur 5:30-6

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this class.

## Grading

- Attendance on work days (usually Fridays): 5%
- Homeworks: 55%
- Midterm: 20%
- Final exam: 20%

Late work is penalized 20% for each day that it is late. Submissions
more than 3 days late receive no credit. Tests cannot be made up
unless a doctor's note is provided.

The grading scale will follow the typical A = 93-100, A- = 90-92, B+ = 87-89, etc.

### Test dates

- Midterm: Wed Sep 27
- Final exam: Thur Dec 14, 11am-1pm

### Attendance

The grading rubric for attendance is as follows, out of 3 points:

- attended at least 75% of work days: 3 pts
- attended at least 50% of work days: 2 pts
- attended at least 25% of work days: 1 pt
- attended fewer than 25% of work days: 0 pts

### Homework

Homework will be submitted via Bitbucket. Create an account on Bitbucket and, for every assignment, create a new repository and add me (username 'joshuaeckroth') as a reader. Always name the repository `csci431-A01` or similar.

See the individual assignments for the grading rubric. Homeworks are always out of 5 points.

## Honor code

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University.

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
