# Midterm review

The midterm will be a paper test. Coding, if any, will be minimal, and will be written on the paper test.

## Overview of AI

- Be able to explain the differences between supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and search (i.e., constraint satisfaction).

## Constraint satisfaction (OptaPlanner)

- Be able to describe appropriate planning entities, planning variables, planning solution, and definitions for hard/soft/medium constraints for an arbitrary constraint satisfaction problem.
- Be able to explain some of the simpler construction heuristics and metaheuristics (see OptaPlanner documentation).

## Logic programming (Prolog)

- Be able to write short Prolog programs to work with: numbers and constraints (using clpr), lists, recursion.
- Be able to explain how unification and resolution work, and trace through examples.
